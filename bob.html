        <p>Bob the Baker was tired of making real donuts and was ready to retire. He needed help to keep his love
            of donuts alive. He wanted someone to create a game that uses button clicks to create virtual donuts for the
            world to enjoy. </p>
        <p>But all those early mornings of donut making may have tired out his brain because Bob had
            some strange requirements for things like 'Auto Clickers' and 'Donut Multipliers'. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, it's always 'Time to make the Donuts' and Bob is too busy to give us guidance on how to
            implement these requirements.
            So we've abliged him here are much as possible. We hope you enjoy playing the Donut Maker as much as we did
            in creating it.
